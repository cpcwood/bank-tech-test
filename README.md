### Overview
Simple CLI banking app, which allows for a user to create a bank account, deposit and withdraw money, then print a statement which returns the history of their transactions.

### How to Install and Run

The app has been developed using Ruby v2.6.5 and is directly run from the command line. Therefore to run the app please ensure you have the following installed:
- ruby 2.6.5 (can be installed from the terminal using homebrew ```brew install ruby``` and version checked using rvm ```rvm use 2.6.5```)
- bundler (can be installed from the terminal through ruby gems ```gem install bundler```)

Once the above has been installed, clone or download the git repository, move to the program root directory, then run the following in the command line to start the program:
- ```bundle```
- ```ruby run_app.rb```

### How to Run Tests
Once the application has been installed and ```bundle``` run, to check the program is fully functional run the test suite can be run. To run the test suite, navigate to the project root directory in the command line, then run the following command ```rspec```. If all tests come back green then the program should function as designed.
